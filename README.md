# Plant size, latitude, and phylogeny explain within-population variability in herbivory
---

This dataset or analysis was produced by the members of The Herbivory Variability Network. It examines global and phylogenetic patterns of herbivory via 790 suveys of 503 plant species. 

Our website is [herbvar.org](https://herbvar.org). We are funded by the US National Science Foundation Research Coordination Networks program. The Principal Investigators (PIs) of the project are William Wetzel (william.wetzel@montana.edu), Phil Hahn, Brian Inouye, Nora Underwood, and Susan Whitehead. The steering committee is the PIs and Karen Abbott, Emilio Bruna, N. IvalÃº Cacho, and Lee Dyer. Our contact information is [here](https://herbvar.org/leadership.html). For the full list of HerbVar members, please see [this webpage](https://herbvar.org/CollaboratorDirectory.html).

This version of the dataset/analysis is associated with our paper "Plant size, latitude, and phylogeny explain within-population variability in herbivory."


## Description of the data and file structure

There are three csv data files in this dataset. Each represents a different biological scale: plant individuals, plant populations, and plant species.

data_plant_level_prep_2023-01-01 10-15-19.csv -- each row is a plant individual
data_survey_level_prep_2023-01-01 10-15-19.csv -- each row is a plant population
data_species_level_prep_2023-01-01 10-15-19.csv -- each row is a plant species
